# AI-Based-Multilingual-Weather-Forecasting-System-Using-Transformers

1. AI-Based Weather Forecast Web App

A real-time weather forecasting system that uses machine learning to predict temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the likelihood of rain for the next 1 to 24 hours. Built with Streamlit, this app delivers live forecasts using data from OpenWeatherMap and trained ML models.

2. Live Demo

Coming Soon – deploy on Streamlit Cloud after uploading this repo.

3. Features

Predicts weather for any city in India, Forecast ranges: next 1, 6, 12, 24 hours 

Outputs:
🌡️ Temperature (°C)
💧 Humidity (%)
🍃 Wind Speed (km/h)
🌧️ Will It Rain (Yes/No)

Real-time data from OpenWeatherMap API Powered by scikit-learn Random Forest + engineered features Cycle-aware model with is_daytime, sin_hour, cos_hour

4. Models Used

RandomForestRegressor for Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed
 
RandomForestClassifier for rain yes/no

Models trained on historical data from 35 Indian cities

5. How to Use

Local Setup

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-forecast-app.git
cd weather-forecast-app

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the app:

streamlit run streamlit_app.py

Replace your_api_key_here in streamlit_app.py with your OpenWeatherMap API key.
